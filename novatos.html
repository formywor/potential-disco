        Terms of Use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) and our Privacy Policy below. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.
        If you use the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization,
        and “you” also refers to that organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that conversational AI can generate inaccurate, misleading, or offensive content.
        Use discretion and independently verify important information.
        ScriptNova does not provide professional advice (medical, legal, financial, safety, or otherwise).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="eligibility">

        <li><strong>Accounts.</strong> The mobile app may operate without a login. If optional accounts are introduced later, you agree to keep credentials secure and not share them.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Requirements.</strong> You need compatible hardware, software, and internet access. Carrier data charges may apply.</li>
        <li><strong>Prohibited Persons.</strong> You represent that you are not subject to embargoes, sanctions, or export restrictions that would prohibit your use of AI services.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="license">
      <h2>3) License & App Distribution</h2>
      <p>
        Subject to your compliance with these Terms, ScriptNova grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
        revocable license to install and use the app on devices you own or control and to access the Services solely for personal or internal business purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When obtained through the Apple App Store, your license is also governed by Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement (LAEULA).
        Apple is not responsible for providing maintenance or support. In the event of any failure of the app to conform to any applicable warranty,
        you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price where applicable; Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="acceptable-use">
      <h2>4) Acceptable Use & Safety</h2>
      <p>To keep ScriptNova safe and useful, you agree you will not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Services to violate any law, intellectual property, or privacy rights.</li>
        <li>Generate or disseminate content that is illegal, sexually explicit involving minors, promotes self-harm, terrorism, or violence.</li>
        <li>Attempt to exploit or harm minors, or collect personal data from children.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, scrape, or otherwise access the Services in a manner inconsistent with normal usage or these Terms.</li>
        <li>Spam, probe, overload, or attempt to bypass security or usage limits.</li>
        <li>Use outputs without appropriate human review in high-risk settings (e.g., medical triage, legal filings, aircraft control, life-support, financial trading).</li>
        <li>Use the Services to build competing foundation models or to benchmark without attribution where required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may throttle, suspend, or terminate access when we reasonably believe your use violates these Terms or risks harm to others.
        We may log and review interactions to provide the Services, troubleshoot issues, detect abuse, and improve safety.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="content">
      <h2>5) Your Content & AI Outputs</h2>
      <h3>5.1 Inputs & User Content</h3>
      <p>
        “<strong>User Content</strong>” includes prompts, messages, files, and media you submit to the app.
        On mobile, your chats are primarily stored on-device unless you export them or enable cloud features in the future.
        You are responsible for your User Content and for obtaining any rights necessary to submit it.
      </p>
      <h3>5.2 AI Outputs</h3>
      <p>
        The Services may generate text, images, or other material (“<strong>Outputs</strong>”). Outputs are probabilistic and may be incorrect.
        You should not rely on Outputs as a sole source of truth or professional advice. You are responsible for vetting Outputs before use or publication.
      </p>
      <h3>5.3 IP Rights</h3>
      <p>
        As between you and ScriptNova, to the fullest extent permitted by law, you own your User Content.
        Subject to these Terms, ScriptNova assigns to you any copyright we may have in the non-third-party portions of the Outputs generated specifically for your prompts, except where models or third-party terms require otherwise (for example, content containing third-party IP).
        You grant ScriptNova a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, process, transmit, and display your User Content and Outputs solely to provide and improve the Services (including safety, debugging, and abuse detection).
      </p>
      <h3>5.4 No Sensitive or Regulated Data</h3>
      <p>
        Do not submit protected health information, government-issued identifiers, financial account numbers, or other highly sensitive data.
        The Services are not designed to comply with sector-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GLBA), unless we expressly agree in writing.
      </p>
      <h3>5.5 Attribution & Disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        If you publish or share Outputs, you should disclose that AI assistance was used where relevant and comply with platform rules and laws regarding synthetic or automated content.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="third-party">
      <h2>6) Third-Party Services & Models</h2>
      <p>
        ScriptNova may connect to APIs, model providers, stores, or analytics tools. Examples include large-language-model APIs,
        in-app purchases through Apple, and optional content hosting or crash reporting.
        Third-party terms may apply; by using those features you agree to those terms. ScriptNova is not responsible for third-party services.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subscriptions">
      <h2>7) ScriptNova Plus, Billing & Refunds</h2>
      <h3>7.1 Subscription</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>ScriptNova Plus</strong> is an optional monthly subscription that may unlock premium models, higher daily limits, faster responses,
        additional tools, and other perks detailed in the app at purchase time. Pricing and features may vary by region and are subject to change.
      </p>
      <h3>7.2 In-App Purchase & Renewal</h3>
      <p>
        Subscriptions are billed through Apple using the payment method associated with your Apple ID.
        Unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period, your subscription renews automatically.
        You can manage or cancel your subscription in your device Settings under Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions.
      </p>
      <h3>7.3 Trials, Upgrades, Downgrades</h3>
      <p>
        Free trials, promotional pricing, or code-based unlocks may be offered. If you upgrade or downgrade, changes typically take effect at the next billing cycle unless stated otherwise.
      </p>
      <h3>7.4 Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        Refunds for purchases made through Apple are handled by Apple per their policies. ScriptNova cannot directly issue refunds for App Store transactions.
      </p>
      <h3>7.5 Taxes & Price Changes</h3>
      <p>
        Listed prices may exclude taxes and fees. We may change pricing or features upon notice; changes take effect at renewal.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="limits">
      <h2>8) Daily Limits, Fair Use & Beta Features</h2>
      <p>
        To preserve quality and safety, the Services enforce daily or per-chat limits that may vary between Free and Plus tiers.
        We may adjust limits dynamically to handle abuse or maintain performance. Experimental features may be labeled “Beta”
        and could be incomplete, slower, or less reliable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- PRIVACY POLICY -->
    <section id="privacy">
      <h2>9) Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how ScriptNova (“we,” “our,” “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Services.
        By using the Services, you consent to the practices described here.
      </p>

      <h3>9.1 Information We Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>App Data You Provide.</strong> Prompts, messages, and attachments you enter. In the mobile app, chats are primarily saved on your device; optional export features let you back up or share data.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Data.</strong> Purchase history, subscription status, and limited metadata provided by Apple for in-app purchases (we do not collect full payment details).</li>
        <li><strong>Device & Usage Data.</strong> Basic device info (model, OS version), app version, language, and general events such as feature usage, error logs, and performance metrics to improve stability and support.</li>
        <li><strong>Support Communications.</strong> When you contact us at <a href="mailto:gomegaassist@gmail.com">gomegaassist@gmail.com</a>, we retain your message and email address to respond.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9.2 How We Use Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Services, including model quality and safety.</li>
        <li>Detect, prevent, and address abuse, security incidents, and technical issues.</li>
        <li>Operate subscriptions, verify eligibility, and process in-app purchases.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about updates, changes, and support.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9.3 AI Training & Data Controls</h3>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use your private mobile chats to train our models unless you explicitly opt in through a future in-app setting.
        Provider models we call may retain logs briefly for abuse prevention and safety per their terms. Do not include sensitive personal data in prompts.
      </p>

      <h3>9.4 Sharing of Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We share information with vendors that help operate the Services (e.g., cloud hosting, crash reporting, subscription validation). They must follow appropriate confidentiality and security obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance.</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or to protect rights, property, or safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> In a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred, subject to this Policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9.5 Data Retention</h3>
      <p>
        On mobile, chats are stored primarily on-device until you delete them or uninstall the app. Transaction records and minimal logs are retained as necessary for accounting, security, or legal compliance. We may anonymize or aggregate data for analytics.
      </p>

      <h3>9.6 Security</h3>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. No security measures are perfect; we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h3>9.7 Cookies & Local Storage</h3>
      <p>
        The mobile app uses local device storage for preferences, chat memory, and daily counters. The website may use cookies or similar technologies for essential functionality and analytics.
      </p>

      <h3>9.8 Do Not Track</h3>
      <p>
        Our Services do not currently respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.
      </p>

      <h3>9.9 International Users</h3>
      <p>
        Information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of information to the United States and other jurisdictions that may have different data-protection rules.
